                    <p>Developing a robust control to maintain balance in the presence of external disturbances has
                        remained one of the primary challenges of humanoid robots.  These robots must be able to
                        perform multiple tasks in highly complex environments. If the robot loses its equilibrium, it
                        might injure nearby people or malfunction, which could be disastrous. Therefore, designing a
                        reliable control method that preserves the robotâ€™s stability is crucial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This research is specifically concerned with the issue of maintaining
                        balance while in an upright stance. Experiments on
                        human balance have shown that people react to disturbance
                        forces by bending their ankles, hips, and arms or taking
                        steps in the case of excessive forces. The "ankle
                        strategy" locks all joints except the ankle and balances the
                        body like an inverted pendulum. When the pushing force
                        is substantially larger, humans utilize a mechanism known
                        as the "hip strategy" to generate momentum by rotating the
                        torso at the hips. By bending the body in the direction of
                        the disturbance force, angular momentum can be immediately
                        generated around the center of mass (CoM), allowing
                        the force of the disturbance to be quickly absorbed. As the
                        disruptive force diminishes, the body attempts to regain its
                        original position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We propose a new controller based on momentum concepts and a new reaching law for sliding mode
                        control that can help the robot withstand higher forces while standing. A demo of the controller
                        in Gazebo simulator can be seen below, where the robot is pushed with a 9 Ns impulse
                        (9000 N in 1 ms). The robot is able to balance and move back to the upright posture after the
                        impact.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The next step is to implement this control on the real physical robot.
                    </p>
